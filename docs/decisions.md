# Design decisions

Why the system is built the way it is. One entry per decision with a stable ID
(`DEC-NNN`, never reused). Code that applies a decision carries a `DEC-NNN`
comment so the reasoning can be found from the code.

**Rules**
- Record decisions that had reasonable alternatives or that someone may want to
  change later; skip obvious details.
- Never delete an entry. When a decision changes, set its status to
  `superseded by DEC-NNN` and explain the change in the new entry.
- Future ideas live in `docs/improvements.md`; when one is implemented, its
  design decision is recorded here.

**Basis** — how firm a decision is, i.e. how freely it can be changed:
- `Required` — demanded by the rubric, the guide or a lab. Change only if the
  requirement allows it.
- `Preferred` — a reasoned choice among valid alternatives. Can change with a
  good reason.
- `Provisional` — a simplification for now. Expected to be revisited when the
  `Revisit when` condition is met.

A decision can mix bases; then each part states its own.

### DEC-001 Labs are implemented inside the project scaffold
- Date: 2026-10-30 · Area: General · Status: accepted
- Basis: Required (C1.1 folder structure; the rubric is what gets graded)
- Context: lab handouts assume a flat repo (`agent.py`, `memory.py`,
  `test_memory.py` at the root), while C1.1 requires `agents/`, `tools/`,
  `tests/`, etc. from the first commit.
- Decision: lab files are mapped into the scaffold (`agents/coder_agent.py`,
  `tools/memory.py`, `tests/test_memory.py`); the agent runs as a module
  (`python -m agents.coder_agent`) and `pytest.ini` puts the repo root on the
  import path. When a lab and a rubric criterion disagree, the criterion wins.
- Why: the course is assessed by the rubric on a single repository; keeping
  labs inside it means every lab adds to the graded system instead of living
  apart.
- Alternatives: separate lab folders or repos — the work would not count
  towards the scaffold and would need porting later.
- Code: `docs/labs/`, `pytest.ini`

### DEC-002 LLM access through OpenRouter with the OpenAI SDK
- Date: 2026-10-30 · Area: LLM client (Lab 1.1) · Status: accepted
- Basis: Preferred (constrained by the available credentials)
- Context: the lab template routes OpenAI calls through Helicone
  (`helicone_client`, model `gpt-4.1-mini`); the available credentials are for
  OpenRouter. The guide lists GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet or Ollama; the rubric
  accepts an equivalent when a named model is unavailable.
- Decision: use the official OpenAI SDK with `base_url` pointing to OpenRouter;
  the client is named `llm_client`; model from `LLM_MODEL`
  (default `openai/gpt-4.1-mini`); key from `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env`.
- Why: OpenRouter is OpenAI-compatible, so the template code barely changes and
  any model can be chosen by configuration. The client was renamed because
  `helicone_client` would misdescribe it (C5.3 readable names).
- Alternatives: Helicone (no credentials); provider-specific SDKs (more code,
  harder to switch models — relevant for C4.5 role-based model allocation).
- Revisit when: Module 4 tracing/cost (C4.1, C4.4) or role allocation (C4.5)
  needs provider features OpenRouter lacks. Document the model choice in the
  README.
- Code: `tools/memory.py` — `llm_client`; `agents/coder_agent.py` — `client`, `MODEL`

### DEC-003 Chroma client and embeddings
- Date: 2026-10-30 · Area: Memory (Lab 1.1) · Status: accepted
- Basis: mixed
  - Chroma as vector store — Required (guide; C1.2)
  - Persistent storage — Required (C1.2: a follow-up must retrieve previously
    stored information, including across runs)
  - `HttpClient` when `CHROMA_HOST` is set — Preferred (prepares C4.8, where
    Chroma runs as its own Docker service)
  - Chroma's default local embedding model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) — Provisional
- Context: long-term memory must survive between runs locally and in Docker.
- Decision: `get_collection()` builds the client lazily: `HttpClient` if
  `CHROMA_HOST` is set, else `PersistentClient(CHROMA_PATH)`; it uses
  `get_or_create_collection` so the first run creates the collection and later
  runs reuse it.
- Why: one code path for local and Docker; lazy creation avoids side effects at
  import time and lets tests inject an in-memory collection. Default embeddings
  need no extra API key or cost.
- Alternatives: in-memory client (loses memory between runs, fails C1.2);
  embeddings through an API (extra key and cost).
- Revisit when: retrieval quality is poor for code-heavy content, or when
  Module 4 adds cost accounting for embeddings.
- Code: `tools/memory.py` — `get_collection`

### DEC-004 Sliding window stores whole turns
- Date: 2026-10-30 · Area: Memory (Lab 1.1) · Status: accepted
- Basis: mixed
  - Keeping the last N turns, N configurable — Required (C1.2)
  - Turns grouped in a `deque(maxlen=N)`; a `"user"` message opens a turn —
    Provisional (simplest model for this lab)
- Context: C1.2 counts conversation *turns*, while `chat()` adds messages one at
  a time (`user`, then `assistant`).
- Decision: `_turns` is a `deque(maxlen=max_turns)`; each item is the list of
  messages of one turn. `add()` opens a new turn on `"user"` and appends any
  other role to the current turn. `get_messages()` flattens the turns.
- Why: evicting whole turns never leaves half a turn in the window, and
  `deque(maxlen=...)` drops the oldest turn by itself. "user opens a turn" is
  the simplest rule for this lab's user → assistant exchange; the ReACT loop was
  deliberately left out of the design.
- Alternatives: flat `deque` of 2N messages (breaks when a turn does not have
  exactly two messages); list with manual eviction (more code, same result).
- Revisit when: the ReACT loop (C1.4) adds `assistant`/`tool` messages inside a
  turn — check tool calls stay paired with their results. Also IMP-001 and
  IMP-002 in `docs/improvements.md` build on this structure.
- Code: `tools/memory.py` — `SlidingWindowBuffer`

### DEC-005 Fail fast on invalid window usage
- Date: 2026-10-30 · Area: Memory (Lab 1.1) · Status: accepted
- Basis: Preferred
- Context: with the current `chat()` a turn always starts with `"user"`, so a
  non-user first message cannot happen today; `max_turns` comes from `.env`, so
  a bad value is possible.
- Decision: `add()` raises `ValueError` if a non-user message arrives with an
  empty window; `__init__` raises `ValueError` if `max_turns < 1`.
- Why: both cases mean a bug or a misconfiguration; a clear error surfaces it at
  once, whereas accepting it would silently corrupt the window
  (`maxlen=0` would discard every message). In line with C4.6 input validation.
- Alternatives: open a turn with the non-user message (hides the misuse); let
  Python raise `IndexError` (cryptic).
- Code: `tools/memory.py` — `SlidingWindowBuffer.__init__`, `SlidingWindowBuffer.add`

### DEC-006 Own memory tests with fake LLM and in-memory Chroma
- Date: 2026-10-30 · Area: Tests (Lab 1.1) · Status: accepted
- Basis: Preferred (the lab's own `test_memory.py` was not provided)
- Context: the lab README points to a `test_memory.py` for verification, but
  only the README was available.
- Decision: `tests/test_memory.py` checks the 3 memory TODOs and `chat()`
  against C1.2, with a fresh `EphemeralClient` collection per test and a fake
  LLM client that records the messages it receives.
- Why: tests run without API keys, network or cost, are deterministic, and can
  inspect exactly what reaches the LLM — the evidence C1.2 asks for.
- Alternatives: tests against the real LLM (cost, flaky, needs a key in CI).
- Revisit when: the official lab test becomes available (align with it), and in
  C1.6 / C4.7, which additionally need a real agent run (smoke / E2E test).
- Code: `tests/test_memory.py`, `pytest.ini`
